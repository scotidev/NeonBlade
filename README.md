# NeonBlade

NeonBlade is a Unity-based game project developed as part of a college assignment. The goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in game development concepts, including player movement, input handling, and UI interaction.

## Project Purpose

This project was created for a university course to showcase skills in game programming, design, and teamwork. It serves as a practical exercise in applying theoretical knowledge to a real-world game development scenario.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity Engine**: The main game engine used for development.
- **C#**: Programming language for game logic and scripting.
- **Unity Input System**: For handling player and UI input across multiple devices.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Preferred IDE for coding and project management.
- **Unity Packages**: Includes modules for 2D animation, UI, multiplayer, timeline, and more.

## Features

- Player movement and actions using the new Unity Input System.
- Support for multiple input devices (keyboard, mouse, gamepad, joystick, XR).
- Modular project structure for easy expansion and maintenance.
- UI navigation and interaction.

## Folder Structure

- `Assets/`: Contains game assets, scripts, scenes, and input actions.
- `Packages/`: Unity package dependencies.
- `.vscode/`: Editor configuration for Visual Studio Code.
- `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes`: Version control settings.
