## About the Project

This project was created to apply game development concepts using **Unity** and **C#**. The main focus was to create a frantic combat experience featuring time management systems and procedural difficulty scaling.

## Mechanics & Gameplay

- **Time System:** The player has a countdown timer representing their remaining life. Killing enemies adds time; taking damage subtracts it. If the timer reaches zero, the samurai explodes (Game Over).
- **Infinite Loop:** Every 60 seconds, the level transitions visually and difficulty increases with tougher enemies.
- **Persistent AI:** Enemies track the player from the moment they spawn, engaging in direct combat or ranged attacks.
- **Power-ups:** Random collectibles that provide extra time, increased damage, or temporary shields.
